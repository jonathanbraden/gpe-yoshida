To Do List:

Conceptual Stuff:
 - Newton approach for finding "vacuum" state (may be needed if we start in false vacuum)

Technical Stuff:
 - Improve the switch between Fourier and Chebyshev expansions (using generic functions, e.g.)
 - Include Lobatto grid in Fast Chebyshev transforms
 - In initialization subroutines, return the chemical potential for the initial state (analytic version when possible).
 - Modularise the Yoshida calculation so only a coefficient matrix is stepped through.  This greatly reduces the amount of code and will make maintenance much easier.
 - Fix normalization on chemical potential to properly account for norm of wavefunction
 - Change norm of wavefunction in ground state finder
 - Add the nu term to the energy calculation
 - Add symmetric basis functions for finding the ground state
